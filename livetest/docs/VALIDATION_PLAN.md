# Live System Validation Plan - Phase 3 Initiation

## Objective
Validate the Advanced Wayland Compositor's Tier 1 protocol implementation through comprehensive testing with real Wayland clients, establishing confidence in the foundation before expanding to Tier 2 protocols.

## Validation Strategy

### Stage 1: Basic Client Connectivity
- **Test simple Wayland clients** (weston-terminal, gtk4-demo, qt applications)
- **Verify protocol negotiation** for all 6 Tier 1 protocols
- **Validate surface creation and basic rendering**
- **Monitor protocol message exchange** with WAYLAND_DEBUG

### Stage 2: Professional Application Compatibility
- **Firefox**: Web browser with complex multi-window workflows
- **LibreOffice**: Office suite with advanced document rendering
- **GIMP**: Graphics editing with complex window management
- **Blender** (if available): 3D modeling with precision input requirements

### Stage 3: Protocol-Specific Validation
- **linux-dmabuf-v1**: GPU buffer sharing validation with hardware acceleration
- **xdg-output-unstable-v1**: Multi-monitor setup testing and configuration
- **zwp-relative-pointer-v1**: Gaming applications or 3D viewport navigation
- **zwp-pointer-constraints-v1**: Pointer lock/capture scenarios
- **wl-drm**: Legacy EGL application compatibility
- **zwp-linux-explicit-sync-v1**: Frame timing and synchronization accuracy

### Stage 4: Performance Baseline Establishment
- **Input latency measurement** with high-precision timing
- **Frame rate stability** under various application loads
- **Memory usage profiling** with valgrind and perf
- **GPU utilization monitoring** during intensive graphics operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All basic Wayland clients connect and render successfully
- [ ] Professional applications launch and maintain stable operation
- [ ] All 6 Tier 1 protocols demonstrate correct behavior under testing
- [ ] Performance meets sub-frame latency targets (< 16.67ms at 60Hz)
- [ ] Clean shutdown and restart cycles without resource leaks

## Validation Tools Required
- **weston-terminal**: Basic terminal application
- **gtk4-demo**: GTK4 demonstration applications
- **WAYLAND_DEBUG=1**: Protocol message inspection
- **valgrind**: Memory leak detection
- **perf**: Performance profiling and timing analysis

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Some protocol edge cases may not be fully implemented
- **Low Risk**: Basic compositor functionality should work based on previous testing
- **Mitigation**: Systematic testing approach will identify issues for targeted fixes

## Timeline Estimate
- **Stage 1-2**: 1-2 development sessions for basic validation
- **Stage 3-4**: 2-3 sessions for comprehensive protocol and performance testing
- **Issue Resolution**: Variable based on discovered gaps

## Next Development Decision Point
Upon successful validation completion:
- **Option A**: Begin Tier 2 protocol implementation for enhanced professional features
- **Option B**: Initiate Vulkan surface integration for hardware-accelerated compositing
- **Option C**: Activate plugin system for extensibility architecture

This validation phase establishes the solid foundation necessary for strategic expansion into advanced compositor features while ensuring professional-grade reliability.
